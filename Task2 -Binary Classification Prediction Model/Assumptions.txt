1. I removed some rows that had alot of NAs to keep data clear and prediction accuracy high.Therefore some data should be ignored.

2. I ignored the presence of variable19 because it did not contribute in the prediction

3. I converted all characters with T&F to booleans

4. I converted Coloumns with k-multiclass to k boolean coloumns

5. I splitted coloumns with multiple values to indivisual coloumns

6. I calculated average for coloumns to fill some NAs in the data
